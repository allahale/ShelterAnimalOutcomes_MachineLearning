# Shelter Animal Outcomes- Machine Learning

Machine learning project to predict shelter animal outcomes using Python, based on the former Kaggle competition at https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes. The project uses pandas to refine the unbalanced data, matplotlib and pandas for EDA, and scikit-learn to run machine learning algorithms (including logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, XGBoost, and Multinomial Naive Bayes).
